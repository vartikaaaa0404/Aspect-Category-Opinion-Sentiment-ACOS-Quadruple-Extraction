my wife also ordered a tea ##pot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n ' t a priority for them to actually bring it .####-1,-1 -1,-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#0
in other words , if they are n ' t making $ $ off of you then you do n ' t rate high on their ' service scale ' .####27,28 -1,-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#0

any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .####-1,-1 -1,-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#0
when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .####-1,-1 -1,-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#0
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment - - to say we had been ` ` blown off ' ' would be an under ##sta ##tem ##ent .####5,6 15,16	SERVICE#GENERAL#0
the manager continually interrupted with ` ` is there anything else i can do for you ? ` ` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .####1,2 36,37	SERVICE#GENERAL#0
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n ' t bothered to get the waitress ##es name .####-1,-1 -1,-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#0
