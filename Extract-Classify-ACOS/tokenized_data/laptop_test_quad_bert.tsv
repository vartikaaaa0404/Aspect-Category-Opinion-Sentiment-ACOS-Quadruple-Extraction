i get that this is meant to store everything in the cloud so it should be no big deal , but when your trying to get work done where there is no access to the internet ( since google doc ##s works off ##line ) it is practically useless when it has to reset itself to factory settings just after turning it on .	-1,-1 OS#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1

i purchased this notebook back in july and was initially happy with my purchase .	3,4 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 10,11
after numerous calls , i then received confirmation the warrant ##y was valid , but only as a ‘ one - off ' .	9,11 WARRANTY#GENERAL 0 -1,-1
as ##us , has a horrible reputation .	0,2 COMPANY#GENERAL 0 5,6
my final verdict - it ' s somewhat solid as a device now that 6 months of updates and delays are behind us .	11,12 LAPTOP#GENERAL 0 -1,-1
bright enough for all uses , and 108 ##0 ##p is perfect - images are sharp .	7,10 DISPLAY#QUALITY 2 0,1	7,10 DISPLAY#QUALITY 2 11,12
- battery life is solid , right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you ' re being with it .	1,3 BATTERY#QUALITY 2 4,5
- touch ##screen is responsive enough for gaming .	1,3 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 4,5
i absolutely imagine chrome apps picking up drastically in quality and quantity now , since it seems like chrome os is really coming into its own this year .	3,5 SOFTWARE#QUALITY 2 -1,-1
- in tablet mode , the screen looks too ‘ tall ' to feel natural ( see the attached picture ) .	6,7 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 1 -1,-1
this screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode .	1,3 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 6,7
after 3 months of use the unit will no longer charge .	6,7 POWER_SUPPLY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1
if it is indeed a software thing and it ' s fixed , i would highly recommend this device .	18,19 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 16,17
second issue is with scaling of the ui .	7,8 SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1
the screen itself is hd 108 ##0 ##p but most ui elements don ' t look good in this resolution .	10,12 SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 13,17
