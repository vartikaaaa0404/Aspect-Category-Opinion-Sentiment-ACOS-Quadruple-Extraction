fantastic computer !####1,2 0,1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#2
i was due to upgrade and this product seemed perfect for me .####7,8 9,10	LAPTOP#GENERAL#2
i have had three mac ##book pro ' s and all have been excellent .####4,9 13,14	LAPTOP#GENERAL#2
the key board is one of the best i ' ve ever typed on .####1,3 7,8	KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#2
this is my first ever mac ##book and i will never go back .####5,7 -1,-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#2
i think the mb ##p tick ##s off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xp ##s ##13 overall .####3,5 -1,-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#2
the mb ##p does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####1,3 -1,-1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mb ##p , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier im ##o ) .####1,3 6,7	BATTERY#GENERAL#2
the track ##pad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .####1,3 -1,-1	KEYBOARD#GENERAL#1
the mb ##p track ##pad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .####1,5 6,7	KEYBOARD#GENERAL#2
the mb ##p 13 ` ` is plenty mobile .####-1,-1 -1,-1	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#2
the one draw ##back is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mb ##p ( especially word , not so much with excel or pp ##t ) , so i ' ve been using google doc ##s / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####12,13 2,4	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#0

adobe apps are also power hog ##s , but that is to be expected .####0,2 -1,-1	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
i also feel like apple hides too much under the hood from the user , but i suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined .####4,5 -1,-1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mb ##p integration .####8,13 2,3	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#2
i love the air ##drop and receiving im ##ess ##ages on my mb ##p ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .####3,5 1,2	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#2
i love the air ##drop and receiving im ##ess ##ages on my mb ##p ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .####-1,-1 -1,-1	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#1
overall , it ' s a great machine .####7,8 6,7	LAPTOP#GENERAL#2
it ' ll be interesting to see what the revisions are in 2016 , but i was worried about the shallow keys of the new mac ##book making their way to the mb ##p and the loss of port options with a new revision , so i am very happy to have this now .####-1,-1 49,50	LAPTOP#GENERAL#2
it works great !####-1,-1 2,3	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#2
i updated it to high sierra and it ' s running smoothly so far .####-1,-1 11,12	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#2

this was a outstanding upgrade from the early 2013 650 ##m model .####-1,-1 3,4	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#2
as far as gaming performance , the m3 ##70 ##x does quite well .####7,10 12,13	GRAPHICS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#2
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frost ##by ##te 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending star ##war ##s battle ##front ( also frost ##by ##te 3 ) .####23,24 26,27	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#2
with the windows 10 / direct ##x 12 improvements , frost ##bit ##e 3 games will do very well on this machine at 105 ##0 ##p graphics / medium / low with the new star ##war ##s game .####21,22 18,19	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#2
nothing beats the quality of the mac os x as well , which is one of the main reasons for this purchase .####6,9 -1,-1	OS#GENERAL#2
but i fed up with the price it cost to upgrade the product as well as the software .####-1,-1 2,4	LAPTOP#PRICE#0
i ventured back to the mac ##book pro world and purchased this model after much research .####12,13 -1,-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#2
one of the first things i noticed after firing up this device was how quiet and effortlessly it performs all tasks that i ask of it .####11,12 14,15	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#2
